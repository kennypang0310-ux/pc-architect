## Approach 1: Cyberpunk Tech Noir

**Design Movement**: Cyberpunk minimalism meets high-tech interfaces, inspired by sci-fi command centers and futuristic HUDs.

**Core Principles**:
- Glowing neon accents against deep dark backgrounds
- Angular geometric shapes and diagonal cuts
- High contrast with luminous interactive elements
- Technical precision with grid overlays and data visualization aesthetics

**Color Philosophy**: Deep space blacks (#0a0a0f) as the foundation, punctuated by electric cyan (#00d9ff) and vibrant magenta (#ff00aa) for interactive elements. The palette evokes a sense of advanced technology and precision engineering—perfect for a PC building tool.

**Layout Paradigm**: Asymmetric diagonal sections with clip-path polygons creating dynamic angles. Hero section uses a 60/40 split with the form floating over a geometric pattern background. Each section transitions with diagonal cuts rather than straight horizontal divisions.

**Signature Elements**:
- Glowing borders with box-shadow creating neon tube effects
- Hexagonal or angular containers for inputs
- Animated gradient borders on hover states
- Subtle grid patterns and scan-line effects in backgrounds

**Interaction Philosophy**: Interactions feel like activating advanced systems—buttons pulse with energy on hover, selections trigger glow effects, and the generate button features a charging animation before submission.

**Animation**: Smooth 300ms transitions for all interactive states. Entrance animations use fade-up with slight scale (0.95 to 1). The generate button features a pulsing glow animation. Form inputs have a subtle border-glow on focus.

**Typography System**: 
- Display: Orbitron (700) for headings—geometric and futuristic
- Body: Inter (400, 500) for form labels and descriptions
- Monospace: JetBrains Mono (500) for technical details and budget display

## Approach 2: Brutalist Precision Workshop

**Design Movement**: Digital brutalism meets Swiss design—raw, functional, and unapologetically bold with extreme clarity.

**Core Principles**:
- Stark black and white foundation with single accent color
- Oversized typography creating visual hierarchy through scale alone
- Exposed structure—borders, grids, and containers are visible and celebrated
- Radical simplicity with maximum information density

**Color Philosophy**: Pure black (#000000) and white (#ffffff) dominate 95% of the interface. A single accent—safety orange (#ff6b00)—is used sparingly for the primary CTA and critical interactive elements. This creates extreme focus and removes all ambiguity about where to act.

**Layout Paradigm**: Rigid grid system with visible borders creating compartmentalized sections. The hero uses a centered stack with massive typography. The form is contained in a thick-bordered box that feels like a technical specification sheet. No rounded corners—everything is sharp 90-degree angles.

**Signature Elements**:
- Thick 3-4px borders on all containers
- Oversized labels (18-20px) above compact inputs
- Dotted or dashed borders for secondary elements
- Raw, unpolished aesthetic that celebrates function over decoration

**Interaction Philosophy**: Interactions are immediate and obvious. Hover states add the accent color to borders. Clicks feel mechanical and precise. No easing—all transitions are linear. The interface responds like a well-oiled machine.

**Animation**: Minimal animation—only 150ms linear transitions. No easing curves. Hover states change border colors instantly. The generate button uses a simple scale transform (0.98) on click to provide tactile feedback.

**Typography System**:
- Display: Space Grotesk (700, 900) for massive headings
- Body: IBM Plex Mono (400, 500) for all interface text—even body copy
- Everything is uppercase for labels, creating uniformity and technical precision

## Approach 3: Soft Gradient Modernism

**Design Movement**: Contemporary gradient design with soft, flowing aesthetics inspired by modern SaaS products and Apple's design language.

**Core Principles**:
- Soft, multi-stop gradients creating depth without harsh shadows
- Generous rounded corners and pill-shaped elements
- Frosted glass effects (backdrop-blur) for layered depth
- Gentle color transitions that feel organic and premium

**Color Philosophy**: A sophisticated gradient system starting from soft lavender (#a78bfa) flowing through rose (#ec4899) to warm coral (#fb923c). Backgrounds use subtle gradient meshes with 3-4 color stops at low opacity. The palette feels modern, approachable, and premium—like a high-end consumer product.

**Layout Paradigm**: Floating card design with the main form appearing to hover above a gradient mesh background. Sections overlap slightly with blur effects creating depth. The layout uses organic spacing that breathes rather than rigid grids.

**Signature Elements**:
- Backdrop-blur glass morphism on cards (backdrop-blur-xl)
- Multi-stop gradient backgrounds with radial patterns
- Soft shadows with multiple layers (shadow-sm + shadow-lg)
- Pill-shaped buttons and inputs with generous padding

**Interaction Philosophy**: Interactions feel smooth and delightful. Hover states lift elements with increased shadows and subtle scale. Focus states add a soft glow. Everything moves with gentle spring animations that feel natural and responsive.

**Animation**: Smooth 400ms cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1) transitions. Entrance animations use gentle fade-up with scale (0.96 to 1). Hover states increase scale to 1.02 and enhance shadows. The generate button features a gradient shift animation on hover.

**Typography System**:
- Display: Plus Jakarta Sans (700, 800) for headings—modern and friendly
- Body: Inter (400, 500, 600) for interface text
- Generous line-height (1.6) and letter-spacing for readability
- Gradient text effects on the main heading using background-clip
